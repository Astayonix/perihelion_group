The nanoviricide® technology enables direct attacks at multiple points on a virus particle. It is believed that such attacks would lead to the virus particle becoming ineffective at infecting cells. Antibodies in contrast attack a virus particle at only a maximum of two attachment points per antibody. Our anti-viral therapeutics that we call "nanoviricides® " are designed to look to the virus like the native host cell surface to which it binds. Since these binding sites for a given virus do not change despite mutations and other changes in the virus we believe that our drugs will be broad-spectrum i.e. effective against most if not all strains types or subtypes of a given virus provided the virus-binding portion of the nanoviricide is engineered appropriately. ...
